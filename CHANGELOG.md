## [6.0.0] - 2025-10-15

### Added
- **Java 17 support**: full compatibility with JDK 17 for all modules.
- **Windows batch utilities**: added `koupper.bat` and `start-octopus.bat` for easier CLI execution on Windows environments.
- **New service providers**:
  - Added `AIProvider` to support requests to OpenAI and other AI APIs.
  - Expanded provider layer for dynamic integrations.
- **JobListener support**: a JobEvent script can now be used as a callback when a job runs.
- **jobsListenerResolvers** map introduced for handling JobListener scripts.
- Added new properties to `KouTask`.
- Added new environment (`env`) methods in the OS layer.
- Added new utilities in `ScriptUtilities`.
- Implemented logging with `@Logger` annotation.
- Added a dedicated **logging module** to the Koupper Gradle configuration.
- Implemented `LoggerHolder` to provide a shared `LOGGER` instance across modules.
- Added default `LogSpec` configuration for Octopus.
- Added JSON helper: `JSONFileHandler.toType()` in `JsonShortcuts.kt`.
- Introduced `ScriptLogger` for scoped log execution in scripts.
- Added support for passing parameters to scripts and executing inline script sentences.

### Changed
- **Core architecture upgrade for jobs**:
  - Jobs configuration can now be defined per function or at the project level.
  - `forEachPending` now returns a list of `JobResult` objects.
  - `JobLister.list` now returns a list of `Any` objects.
- **Scripting engine replaced**:
  - Migrated from the previous `Jsr223ScriptingHost` to **`BasicJvmScriptingHost`** for better performance and native Kotlin handling.
- Updated validation logic in `ModuleAnalyzer` to better identify HTTP configuration files.
- Renamed `EXTENSIONS_FOLDER_NAME` property used for locating scripts.
- `Octopus.run(...)` now receives the script path as a parameter.
- Relocated `LoggerCore` into a dedicated logging module.
- Updated the default destination for the annotation resolver to `console`.
- `ListenersRegistry`: worker threads now inherit the parent `Thread.contextClassLoader` (prevents losing classpath/loggers on replay).
- `JobRunner.runCompiled` now returns the function **result** and uses `trySetAccessible()` when needed.
- `FileJobDriver` now logs via `LoggerHolder.LOGGER` instead of `println`.
- Set `file` as default work driver for JobListener setup.
- SQS configuration now falls back to IAM credentials if environment variables are not set.

### Fixed
- Script logs during replay now respect the destination configured by `@Logger` (no longer dumped into `Octopus.Dispatcher`).
- Fixed `ClassCastException` caused by `StringBuilder` return in `JobsListenerSetup.run` (now returns `String`).
- Fixed `NullPointerException`/`ClassCastException` when reading `@JobsListener(debug = ...)` and `time`: added coercion for `Boolean`/`String`/`Number`.

### Improved
- General cleanup of unused or redundant code across modules.
- Implemented resolvers to handle scripts via annotation.
- Changed `run` method to use `SignatureDispatcher` instead of `annotationResolvers`.
- Returned response from executed scripts now validates `Unit` as a type instead of an object.
- Improved `Logger` annotation handling: destination now supports string patterns for file names.
- Changed annotation processing flow: validation is now handled independently per annotation.
- Improved internal `run` method implementation for Octopus.
- Enhanced logging system based on configured properties or annotations.

### Notes
- When parsing annotation text, compiler defaults donâ€™t apply automatically; safe coercion was added for `debug` and `time`.
- If your `captureLogs` returns `(logs, result)`, adjust destructuring accordingly.
